nannanThe authors would also like to detect different categories of AS (architectural smells) that could impact different quality attributes, such as performance and security; in this direction, we could identify and compute different ADI index profiles according to the AS's impact on specific quality attributes.In future work, we plan to study the process of issue removal to determine which issues are the most costly to remove and generally extend this analysis to a wider range of project domains and sizes.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanNoIn the future we plan to continue our research on what other ATD items can be found and what other impact measures can be combined together for having the complete picture of ATD and its interest, which would greatly help the decision making of the main stakeholders. We also plan to investigate the reasoning behind the architectural violations, whatever they are intentional or not, and whatever or which the architectural violations benefit the final product. Finally, stakeholders that were part of the early evaluation of the tool said that it would be valuable to see the evolution of the debt. They wanted to see if the tendency is that the debt increases or decreases over time, as well as see what impact planned or potential future changes would have.In future work, we are interested in verifying how much architectural issues affect the overall quality, with the aim of giving different relevance to architecture and design issues w.r.t. coding ones in a TDI. We plan to investigate the role of code and architectural smells in TD, since they are associated to known solutions, that can speed up their resolution process. We would like also to work on the definition of a new TDI, with a focus on code and architectural debt, and experiment it on a large dataset of projects. In the TDI computation we would like to consider: 1) Code and Architectural smells detection; 2) Code and architecture/design metrics; 3) History of a system, including code changes and lifespan of smells; 4) Identification of problems more critical than others, to weight the collected analysis elements (e.g., metrics, smells, issues) according to their relevance in existing (past) projects.Our study generates a number of avenues for future work. First, it provides a benchmark for future studies that seek to examine the relationship between measures of architecture and the costs associated with maintenance and adaptation. Second, it provides methods for evaluating the technical debt associated with software architecture, which could be verified via future empirical studies across a larger number of contexts and systems. Finally, while we focus only on the costs associated with corrective maintenance, a significant amount of the value from refactoring is likely to come from an increase in developer productivity when responding to new requirements. It is our hope that the methods we describe can provide a springboard for undertaking such enquiries.As future work, we plan to extend our tooling to mine archi- tectural smells directly from Git repositories, thus allowing us to link the current information to code churn and investigate the effects of smells on change rates.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannan
