Future work will include convolutional neural networks to train a model to understand diagrams made in PowerPoint or another tool and saved as an image, such as IMEAV [19]. We also plan to include a recommendation system to suggests repayment strategies under certain conditions. Different meta- models for storing ATD should be reviewed. Finally, we will also look into including automatic text extraction methods for audio/video recordings to reduce human interaction.nanThe authors would also like to detect different categories of AS (architectural smells) that could impact different quality attributes, such as performance and security; in this direction, we could identify and compute different ADI index profiles according to the AS's impact on specific quality attributes.In future work, we plan to study the process of issue removal to determine which issues are the most costly to remove and generally extend this analysis to a wider range of project domains and sizes.nannannannannanAs future work, we plan to fully automate the process and empirically evaluate it via large-scale experimentsNonanIn future experiments, we aim to similarly consider other tools, e.g., the commercial tool CAST, tools that provide dependency analysis and other tools developed in academia, e.g., Hotspot Detector, TamDera. Moreover, we are interested in inspecting other dimensions of archi- tectural debt, as the history of projects, and in analyzing large-scale industrial systems.nannannannannannannannannanNoNoIn the future we plan to continue our research on what other ATD items can be found and what other impact measures can be combined together for having the complete picture of ATD and its interest, which would greatly help the decision making of the main stakeholders. We also plan to investigate the reasoning behind the architectural violations, whatever they are intentional or not, and whatever or which the architectural violations benefit the final product. Finally, stakeholders that were part of the early evaluation of the tool said that it would be valuable to see the evolution of the debt. They wanted to see if the tendency is that the debt increases or decreases over time, as well as see what impact planned or potential future changes would have.We plan to investigate the role of code and architectural smells in TD, since they are associated to known solutions, that can speed up their resolution process. We would like also to work on the definition of a new TDI, with a focus on code and architectural debt, and experiment it on a large dataset of projects. In the TDI computation we would like to consider: 1) Code and Architectural smells detection; 2) Code and architecture/design metrics; 3) History of a system, including code changes and lifespan of smells; 4) Identification of problems more critical than others, to weight the collected analysis elements (e.g., metrics, smells, issues) according to their relevance in existing (past) projects.Our study generates a number of avenues for future work. First, it provides a benchmark for future studies that seek to examine the relationship between measures of architecture and the costs associated with maintenance and adaptation. Second, it provides methods for evaluating the technical debt associated with software architecture, which could be verified via future empirical studies across a larger number of contexts and systems. Finally, while we focus only on the costs associated with corrective maintenance, a significant amount of the value from refactoring is likely to come from an increase in developer productivity when responding to new requirements. It is our hope that the methods we describe can provide a springboard for undertaking such enquiries.As future work, we plan to extend our tooling to mine archi- tectural smells directly from Git repositories, thus allowing us to link the current information to code churn and investigate the effects of smells on change rates.nannanNoThe qualitative data derived from the survey are not based on measured or observed data but on estimations made by the respondents. In future studies, we plan to include physical measurements and observations, to create a stronger reliability of the data. The result of this research may be affected by some threats to validity.NonannannannannannannannannannannannanThe author want to do a survey in real world about risk architecture in software industry.nan
